About this Manual
-----------------
This is user manual for the CheckSum Tool. It is still work in progress,
as is the tool itself.

The most important chapter is the Quick Start chapter which show how to
get started with the CheckSum Tool. Other chapters have more in detail
information about the tool.

[[QuickStartCh]]
Quick Start
-----------
The main window of the tool contains toolbar,list of filenames and checksums
and statusbar. The toolbar has controls for most frequently used features,
like creating and verifying checksums and changing checksum type. The file
list contains filename (and some other attributes) and checksum for the file.
The statusbar show some status information from the tool, like amount of
files in the list.

The most frequently used features are explained shortly below:

- opening checksum files
- verifying checksums
- adding files to the list
- saving checksums to file

Opening the File Containing Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To open a file containing checksums, select _File | Open_ from main menu. Or
click the _Open_ button in the toolbar. In the dialog, browse for and select
the file to open. The filename must contain or have an extension one of +sfv+,
+md5+ or +sha1+. Otherwise CheckSum Tool does not recognize the file type.

If the tool can read the file, files in the checksum file are added into
the list in the main window. Checksums are visible, but the tool does not
automatically verify them.

Verifying the Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When there is files with checksums in the main window, those checksums can be
verified against checksums of actual files in disk. Select _Checksums |
Verify All_ from the main menu or click verify icon from the toolbar.

The tool compares checksums in the main window and checksums calculated from
files in the disk. If the checksums are identical, *OK* text is added to
_Verified_ column in the main window. After all files are checked message is
shown if all files were verified OK or not.

NOTE: Verifying might take some time if files are big.

Adding Files to the List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to add new files to the list:

- selecting single files to add
- add all files in folder (and subfolders)

Single files can be added by selecting _File | Add Files..._ from the main menu
or from toolbar. This adds only the files selected in the dialog.

All files in the folder can be added by selecting _File | Add Folder..._ from
the main menu. This adds all files in the selected folder. If the selectec
folder contains any subfolders, user is asked if files in those subfolders
should be added also. Answering _No_ tho the guestion adds only the selected
folder. Answering _Yes_ adds all files in all the subfolders too.

Saving File List to Checksum File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the main window contains list of files which have checksums calculated,
they can be saved to checksum file. Select _File | Save_ or _File |
Save As..._ from the main menu. Select the filename and location for the file.

NOTE: While you can change filename extension, you cannot change the checksum
type in this dialog. Changing the filename extension might cause problems for
this tool and other programs reading the file.

Installing
----------

Prerequisities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CheckSum Tool requires:

- Windows operating system
- .Net 4.0 framework or later installed

Download links for the .Net 4.0 framework:

- http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992[.Net framework 4.0 web installer]
- http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=0a391abd-25c1-4fc0-919f-b21f31ab88b7[.Net framework 4.0 standalone installer]

Using the Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The easiest way to install CheckSum Tool is to download and run the installer
executable from http://checksumtool.sourceforge.net[]. The installer checks
if the required .Net 4.0 runtime (or later) is installed. If the .Net framework
cannot be found, the installer aborts.

Running the installer copies program- and documentation files to the system
and adds the tool to Windows Start-menu.

Using the Archive Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The another way to install CheckSum Tool is to download binary archive file and
extract files in it to some folder. All required files are in the archive file
and CheckSum Tool can be run from the folder where the binary file was
extracted.

Binary archive files can be downloaded from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=208291[CheckSum Tool's downloads].
Files are named +CheckSumTool-version-bin.zip+, for example
+CheckSumTool-0.8.0-bin.zip+.

About the Checksums
-------------------
Checksums for files (or practically for any data) are numbers that are
calculated from the given data using one-direction algorithm. One-direction
algorithm means that one can calculate a checksum for the data. But the data
cannot be determined from the checksum.

The algorithm is designed so that every possible data provides its own unique
checksum. That means there should not be possibility for two files with the
same checksum. With some older algorithms those duplicates are possible. With
newest algorithms duplicates are not possible in practice.

Naming of the CheckSum Tool can be a bit misleading - strictly speaking MD_x_
and SHA-_x_ are not checksums but cryptographic hashes. But generally speaking
they can be called as checksums as they are used like traditional CRC checksums.

See Wikipedia articles for:

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum[Checksum]
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function[Hash functions]

Wikipedia also has articles for most common checksum and hash functions. Please
see those articles for more information.

Uses for the Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most common use for the checksums is to verify data integrity when storing
and transferring it. If the checksums before and after the operation match,
data has not been changed during the operation. For example FTP server can
have checksum file next to files to download. Checksums for files in the server
were calculated by the person putting files in the server. Now when somebody
downloads the files and the checksum file, one can verify all files are
correctly transferred (identical to files in the server) by calculating
checksums for the downloaded files and comparing checksums to checksums in the
checksum file.

How CheckSum Tool helps?

- it makes easy to create checksum file for your file(s)
- it makes it easy to open checksum file and verify files in disk match to
  checksums in checksum file


Using the CheckSum Tool
-----------------------
The main window is where almost all the work happens. As described in the 
<<QuickStartCh,Quick Start>> -chapter, it contains list of files for which to
calculate and/or verify checksum.

The File List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file list shows files processed and their related information, including
the checksum. Visible columns and their data are:

- File's filename
- File's checksum, which can be:
  * loaded from the checksum file
  * calculated from the file in the disk
- Verification status, which can be:
  * empty - not yet verified
  * *OK* - checksum matches to the file in the disk
  * *FAIL* - checksum does not match the file in the disk
- Full path to the file
- Size of the file

The checksum is shown as a hexadecimal string. The length of the checksum
depends on the checksum type.

Calculating Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First select the checksum type from the toolbar. Note that when checksum type
is changed all checksums from the list are cleared.

Checksums for the files in the list are calculated by selecting the _Calculate_
feature (from the toolbar or from the _CheckSums_ menu). After the checksums
for all files are calculated, they are added to the list. Length of the
checksum varies by used algorithm.

Verifying Checksums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Checksums in the list can be verified by selecting the _Verify_ feature (from
the toolbar or the menu). If one or more files do not have checksum in the list,
those files are not verified (as there is nothing to verify).

When all files (that can be verified) are verified, verification status (*Ok*
or *FAIL* is added to the list.

Loading Checksum file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Existing checksum file can be loaded by selecting _File | Open_ from main menu
or clicking the _Open_ button in the toolbar. In the dialog, browse for and
select the checksum file to open. The filename must contain or have an
extension one of +sfv+, +md5+ or +sha1+. Otherwise CheckSum Tool does not
recognize the file type. (_This will be improved in later versions._)

CheckSum Tool considers lines that begin with semicolon (+;+) in checksum file
as comment lines and ignores them. E.g. line +; Created 1/4/2008 1:23:17 AM+ is
ignored.

Saving Checksum file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When one or more files have calculated checksums in the list, they can be saved
to the checksum file. Only files that have checksum calculated are added to the
file. Verification status is not added.

Files in the same folder than or in the subfolders of checksum file are stored
with relative path. Files in other folders are stored with absolute path.

Select _File | Save_ or _File | Save As..._ from the main menu. Select the
filename and location for the file in the dialog. It is recommeded to use file
extensions that the dialog suggests:

- +sfv+ for CRC32 files
- +md5+ for MD5 files
- +sha1+ for SHA-1 files

Using these file extensions makes sure CheckSum tool (and many other tools)
recognize the file type.
